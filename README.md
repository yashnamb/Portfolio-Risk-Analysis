# Financial Portfolio Analyzer

A full-stack Streamlit dashboard to analyze, simulate, and visualize your investment portfolio with advanced financial metrics, real-time data, and interactive plots. User centric for first time starters, part time investors and students who are just breaking into stock market.

# ⚠️ Due to rate limits in the yfinance library, the Yahoo Finance API may not work reliably on the deployed Streamlit app.
Please clone the repo and run the app locally to ensure full functionality.

##  Data Sources

### 📉 Historical Data
Pulled using the `yfinance` API:
- Daily adjusted closing prices for user-selected stocks
- Historical S&P 500 index data (`^GSPC`) for benchmark comparison
- Used in: performance, risk metrics, Monte Carlo simulation, clustering

### 📈 Real-Time Data
- Real-time stock prices fetched using `yfinance.Ticker().history(period='1d')`
- Used to calculate live total investment value and show recent prices
